7. 	Booking Procedures 
i. 	For each reservation, a maximum of five rooms and up to twenty-one nights per stay can be booked online. 
ii. 	If nine rooms or more are requested it will be considered a group booking and the system will automatically redirect the request to the Group RFP (request for proposal) module.
iii. 	Hotels and apartment rates are quoted per room, per night and may be described as follows: Best Available; Room only; Bed & Breakfast; Half Board; Full Board, and All Inclusive.
iv. 	The Best Available Rate will be displayed when the requested rate plan is not available. The Best Available Rate refers to the pre-discounted, or non-commissionable lowest rate for rooms, inclusive of taxes (unless stated in the booking details), special promotional rates and/or restricted rates that are offered to the general public by the any hotel supplier. 
v. 	The number of persons in a booking must be specified, regardless of whether they are children or adults. When booking children, the child's age must be specified. As evidenced by the booking details, breakfast for children is not always included in the rate, especially when a child sharing the room is free of cost.

8. 	Accommodation Services
i. 	Accommodation services are classified as follows: five star, four star, three star and two star hotels and serviced apartments. Classifications are provided to us by the accommodation provider. While we endeavour to use reasonable care to validate and authenticate the information provided, by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you accept that we cannot be held responsible for inaccurate information provided to us by the Travel Component supplier, including but not limited to images, descriptions, amenities and facilities. 
ii. 	The maximum number of guests on the booking must equate to the following room categories e.g.: 
A. 	For hotels: single - one adult, double or twin -two adults, triple - three adults and quad - four adults; and  
B. 	For serviced apartments: studio - two adults, one bedroom -two adults, two bedrooms - four adults, three bedrooms - six adults, four bedrooms - eight adults and five bedrooms - ten adults.
iii. 	Extra beds for adults and children may also be requested. Upon request, the system will automatically scan the database and display hotels with room types and categories that match the search criteria based on the maximum number of occupants allowed in the room.
iv. 	In the event a booking requires additional meals for adults and children, the meal types available and the number of meals may be booked at the time of the reservation is made. The rates are quoted per meal, per person, net non-commissionable and may include applicable taxes and service charges.
vi.	Additional charges for housekeeping (for serviced apartments) or any other relevant services charges will be shown in the tariff notes at the time of booking.

9. 	Bookings from Allocations
Travel Business will receive immediate booking confirmation for Travel Components that are shown as available. The booking is instantaneously sent to the supplier to update the reservation with their reference number. Once updated, the booking reference may be viewed online. 


10. 	Bookings on Request
i. 	On request bookings are bookings that cannot be confirmed at the time of booking and will require the supplier's written confirmation for the requested Travel Components due to DOTW's allocations having been exhausted and/or the rate not being available for the requested dates. The booking will automatically be sent to the supplier who may accept or deny the request, choose to confirm the booking at a higher rate (although every attempt will be made to confirm the requested service at the contracted rate), or offer a different room type. If rooms are not available at a higher rate or room type, the requested service will be denied and an alternative property of the same category, location and price range will be offered. 
ii. 	When a booking is made and confirmed at a higher rate, different room type, or an alternate property, Travel Business must accept the confirmed services prior to the Cancellation Deadline or the booking will be automatically released without penalty.

11. 	Minimum Stay	
The system will automatically apply the Travel Component's minimum stay restrictions and display the rates and availability for the minimum stay period even if the request is for less than the number of minimum days.

12. 	Transfers and Sightseeing Tours
The rates for transfers and tours vary depending on whether they apply to private vehicles or scheduled tours/transfers. For private vehicles, rates are quoted &quot;per vehicle&quot; up to the maximum capacity of the vehicle. For scheduled transfers and tours, the rates are quoted for the total number of passengers and vary on the type of vehicle used.

13. 	Visas Services for the United Arab Emirates
i. 	The visa application module to book visas to the United Arab Emirates will be made available only to a Travel Business that has signed our visa service agreement (&quot;Visa Agreement&quot;).  Approval of any Visa Agreement is at DOTW's sole discretion.  
ii. 	A visa application shall only be considered if it is booked on the same itinerary as a Travel Component consisting of a confirmed hotel or apartment reservation in the United Arab Emirates, for a minimum period of three nights, in an establishment that has a three star rating or higher.   
iii. 	Travel Business cannot cancel or amend an accommodation booking to less than three nights once a visa approved.
iv. 	Visa services are non-refundable.  
v. 	You acknowledge that payment is due irrespective of whether the visa is approved by the immigration authorities or not. DOTW cannot under any circumstances guarantee the approval of, or be held responsible for, the denial of a visa application by UAE immigration authorities.  
 
14. 	Refunds
i. 	Refund requests must be in writing and received within thirty (30) days from the intended commencement date of the Travel Component in order to be processed. 
ii. 	Refund requests will only be processed once it is confirmed that the intended Travel Components have not been utilized and the refund request complies with the terms and conditions of the booking. Travel Business understands and confirms that any refund request that does not fall under the requisite terms and conditions of the booking will be denied. 
iii. 	Refund requests require a minimum of twenty-one (21) days for processing. No claims will be reviewed once a refund is processed.
